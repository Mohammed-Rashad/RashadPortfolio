# My Father's Personal Webpage

This is a personal website created for my father to showcase his background, interests, and achievements. It's a simple, elegant platform where visitors can learn more about himâ€”whether for professional networking, sharing personal passions, or keeping in touch.

For now it is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript website that might expand later with more features and content.

This is originally a replication of my dad's CV
